The Committee is a 17 person team which is elected yearly to run all aspects of the society.

## Helpdesk
The Helpdesk is made up of the wonderful Conor Berns (berns) and Connor Mulready (mulreac).

The Helpdesk is what it sounds like, a desk for help. No seriously, we're here
to help out and answer any questions at all to help you make the most of
Redbrick. Don't be shy now, feel free to mail or hey us any time and check out
the help section we maintain.

We also run regular tutorial in the CA labs in DCU, any member can attend and we
will guide you through the basics and answer any queries, watch out for notices
and posters around campus or on Redbrick.

The Helpdesk tutorials can be found [here](/help/tutorials/).
